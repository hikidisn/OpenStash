    Im sry uniub, i wont actually post this unless you are ok with it.
    This will only work if you are on chrome v120, idk if it works on anything else yet. So first off make sure that devtools://devtools/bundled/devtools_app.html is unblocked on your chromebook.
    There are other methods for this but i perfer you use this website "devtools://devtools/bundled/devtools_app.html?experiments=true&ws=rigtools.appleflyer.xyz". When it loads you will need to go
    to the "network" tab, and doubble tap the litteral only check mark on the screen. If you fail at this then get off right now because you will have no idea whats going on. Go to your extentions page 
    and find either goguardian, or lanschool for chromebooks. SECURLY WILL NOT WORK! Then you will copy the extention id, and go back to the page you were just on and press q. Paste the extention id in 
    and start disabling. You can re-enable any extentions you want.
