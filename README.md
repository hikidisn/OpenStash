# Note from UniUB
**Hey dude, its fine that your using these exploits, All I would want is some credit for writing up the guides. Maybe a link to the site? or just straight up fork the repo at https://github.com/uniub/uniub.github.io**

# Note back
**I will only use that one exploit likely just because it works so well, also i kinda added more detail to make it easyer to use/understand, feel free to use that info if you want**
